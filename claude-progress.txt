# Autonomous Coding Session Tracker
# Updated: 2026-01-18

================================================================================
SESSION 1 - INITIALIZATION
================================================================================
Date: 2026-01-18
Agent: Initializer Agent
Status: IN_PROGRESS

SUMMARY:
This is the first session for the CanvasCast autonomous coding project. The
Initializer Agent has analyzed the comprehensive PRD documentation and created
a structured development environment for future coding agents.

WHAT WAS FOUND:
- Existing feature_list.json with 156 features across 12 phases
- Comprehensive PRD documentation in docs/prds/
- Monorepo structure with apps/web, apps/api, apps/worker
- Packages: shared, remotion
- All features currently marked as "passes: false"

WHAT WAS CREATED:
- claude-progress.txt (this file) - session tracking log
- README.md - comprehensive project documentation
- .env.example files for all apps (pending)

PROJECT STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:
✓ Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
✓ 3 apps: web (Next.js), api (Express), worker (BullMQ)
✓ 2 packages: shared (types/schemas), remotion (video composition)
✓ Supabase for database, auth, storage
✓ 18 detailed PRDs covering all subsystems
✓ Implementation guides for migration from BlankLogo

DEVELOPMENT PHASES:
Phase 1: Foundation (5 features) - Project setup, monorepo, shared packages
Phase 2: Database (15 features) - Schema, migrations, RLS, RPC functions
Phase 3: Authentication (8 features) - Supabase auth, middleware, flows
Phase 4: Draft System (3 features) - Pre-auth prompt capture
Phase 5: API (13 features) - Express server, endpoints, webhooks
Phase 6: Worker (4 features) - BullMQ worker, pipeline orchestration
Phase 7: Pipeline Steps (14 features) - 9-step video generation + Remotion
Phase 8: Frontend (17 features) - Next.js UI, pages, components
Phase 9: Billing (6 features) - Stripe integration, credits
Phase 10: Email (7 features) - Transactional notifications
Phase 11: Storage (3 features) - Asset storage, cleanup
Phase 12: Testing & Deploy (11 features) - Tests, monitoring, CI/CD

PRIORITY BREAKDOWN:
- P0 (Critical): 106 features - Must complete for MVP
- P1 (High): 39 features - Important for production
- P2 (Medium): 11 features - Nice to have

RECOMMENDED START:
Begin with Phase 1 (Foundation) to ensure:
1. Monorepo is properly configured
2. Shared types/schemas are in place
3. Environment variables are documented
4. Remotion package is initialized

Then proceed to Phase 2 (Database) to:
1. Run all migrations
2. Test RPC functions
3. Verify RLS policies

ACTIONS COMPLETED:
✓ Created claude-progress.txt (this file)
✓ Created comprehensive README.md with:
  - Quick start guide
  - Architecture diagrams
  - Tech stack overview
  - Development commands
  - Environment variables documentation
  - 156 features overview
✓ Created AUTONOMOUS_AGENT_GUIDE.md with:
  - Step-by-step workflow for autonomous agents
  - Testing strategies
  - Acceptance criteria examples
  - Common patterns and issues
  - Session logging templates

INFRASTRUCTURE AUDIT:
✓ Monorepo structure in place (pnpm workspace)
✓ 3 apps configured: web, api, worker
✓ 2 packages: shared, remotion
✓ 9 database migration files exist
✓ .env.example files exist for all apps
✓ API server code exists (~20KB in apps/api/src/index.ts)
✓ Worker pipeline code exists (~8KB in apps/worker/src/pipeline/runner.ts)
✓ 16 pipeline step files exist
✓ Frontend pages exist (landing, signup, login, dashboard, job status, etc.)
✓ Supabase clients and middleware implemented
✓ Remotion compositions set up

VERIFICATION NEEDED:
⚠ All 156 features marked "passes: false" - need verification
⚠ Database migrations need testing (apply and verify tables)
⚠ API endpoints need functional testing
⚠ Worker pipeline needs end-to-end testing
⚠ Frontend components need integration testing
⚠ Shared types/schemas need import testing

NEXT STEPS FOR CODING AGENTS:
1. **Start with Phase 1 (Foundation)**: FOUND-001 through FOUND-005
   - Verify monorepo setup works (pnpm install, workspace linking)
   - Check shared types package exports correctly
   - Verify Zod schemas are defined and working
   - Test environment configuration
   - Verify Remotion package renders test video

2. **Then Phase 2 (Database)**: DB-001 through DB-015
   - Apply migrations: pnpm supabase start && pnpm supabase db push
   - Verify all tables exist in Supabase Studio
   - Test RPC functions (credit operations, draft claims)
   - Verify RLS policies work
   - Test triggers (new user → profile + credits)

3. **Document as you go**:
   - Mark "passes": true only when ALL acceptance criteria met
   - Update this file after each session
   - Note any blockers or issues

4. **Use the guides**:
   - Read AUTONOMOUS_AGENT_GUIDE.md for detailed workflow
   - Reference DEVELOPER_HANDOFF.md for architecture
   - Check docs/prds/ for subsystem details

NOTES:
- Significant infrastructure already exists from scaffolding
- Priority: Verify existing code before implementing new features
- Quality over speed - production system requires thorough testing
- Use feature_list.json as the source of truth for progress

RECOMMENDED FIRST SESSION TASKS:
1. Run `pnpm install` and verify no errors
2. Run `pnpm supabase start` and verify local Supabase works
3. Run `pnpm supabase db push` and check migrations
4. Run `pnpm dev:all` and verify all services start
5. Mark FOUND-001 as passing if all works
6. Continue with FOUND-002 through FOUND-005
